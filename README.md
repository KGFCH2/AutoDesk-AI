# 🤖 AutoDesk AI – Notion Execution Agent

**Created by [Babin Bid](https://github.com/KGFCH2)**

AutoDesk AI is a cinematic, professional-grade execution dashboard that orchestrates autonomous AI agents directly within your Notion workspace.

## 👤 Developer Profile

- **Developer**: Babin Bid
- **GitHub**: [KGFCH2](https://github.com/KGFCH2)
- **Email**: [babinbid05@gmail.com](mailto:babinbid05@gmail.com)
- **LinkedIn**: [babinbid123](https://linkedin.com/in/babinbid123)

## ✨ What it does

- 📥 **Deep Notion Integration**: Fetches pending missions from your database.
- 🧠 **Multi-Tier Classification**: Uses Llama 3.1 8B for sub-second task parsing.
- ⚡ **Autonomous Execution**: Powerful Llama 3.3 70B models generate content, research, and perform analysis.
- 🕒 **Historical Timeline**: Tracks exact completion times and historical mission logs.
- 📊 **Mission Control**: Features a "Mission Control" center with real-time success rates and engine status metrics.

## 🎯 Core product idea

**Notion is the Command Center, AutoDesk is the Engine.** 🚀
Users create tasks in Notion → AutoDesk scans and classifies them → AI agents execute the logic → Results are pushed back to Notion in real-time.

## 🌟 Modern Features

- 🎨 **Asymmetric Hero Design**: A cinematic, ultra-wide landing page with 3D product mocks.
- 🏛️ **Mission Control Dashboard**: Glassmorphic UI with analytics (Engine Status, Success Rate).
- 📜 **Task Intelligence Modal**: A full-screen portal for managing active queues and historical timelines.
- 📱 **Mobile First**: Fully responsive layout with touch-optimized controls.
